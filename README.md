# hello-world
This repository is for practicing using GitHub
I am a self-learner who is trying to learn the necessary skills for bioinformatics via coursera.
I have a BS in Biology from University of Michigan-Flint (2021).
I intend to apply to grad school once I feel confident enough with my skill level and have some decent projects in my portfolio.
